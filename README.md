# Supply Chain KPI Tracker

## Project Overview
End-to-end supply chain analytics project analyzing 2 years of operational data
across 15 suppliers, 6 warehouses, and 15 major customers in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.

## KPIs Tracked
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Order Fill Rate
- Perfect Order Rate
- Inventory Turnover
- Supplier Defect Rate
- Freight Cost per Unit
- Warehouse Utilization
- Customer Satisfaction Score
- Return Rate
- Stockout Rate

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (SQLite queries for data analysis)
- **Power BI** (Interactive dashboard)
- **Excel** (Report generation)

## Dataset
- 10 interconnected CSV files
- 8,000+ records covering Jan 2023 - Dec 2024
- Realistic supply chain data for the Middle East region

## Key Findings
1. On-Time Delivery Performance is critically below target (61%), with 422 delayed orders primarily driven by supplier lead time variability and customs delays.
2. Perfect Order Rate is significantly low (0.6%), indicating systemic quality and fulfillment process gaps.
3. Customer Satisfaction is weak (2.86/5) and strongly influenced by delivery delays and product quality issues.
4. Return Rate exceeds acceptable threshold (8.2%), with major drivers being damaged shipments and incorrect item fulfillment.
5. Supplier Defect Rate (2.34%) directly impacts order quality and customer returns, highlighting the need for stricter quality controls.
6. Warehouse utilization at 70.8% suggests optimization opportunities, especially across under-utilized locations.
7. Freight cost per unit ($17.76) indicates potential savings through shipping mode consolidation and route optimization.
